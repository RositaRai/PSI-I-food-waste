# PSI-I-food-waste

## About the project
The goal as the name suggests is reducing food waste. We want to create an app which
let's restaurants make better use of food leftovers by selling it with discount. 

We don't plan on making deliveries or selling food but rather informing who sells it.
Essentially, restaurants post their discounts and other users see them on the map.
